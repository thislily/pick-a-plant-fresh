## What's this?

A quiz that matches you with your plant soulmate. Built with React and configured through JSON - because I wanted to see how clean I could make a form system without hardcoding everything.

## Features

🌿 Plant personality quiz  
🔧 JSON-configured forms
🛡️ Real-time validation  
📱 Responsive design  
⚡ Built with React + Vite  

## Tech Stack

React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, JSON configuration, Netlify

## Run locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thislily/pick-a-plant-fresh.git
cd pick-a-plant-fresh
npm install && npm run dev
```

## How it works

The whole quiz is configured in `src/config/formConfig.json` - questions, validation rules, everything. Change the JSON, change the form. No React code needed.
